### Backend:

##### My contribution was predominantly backend and included:

       Setting up the database using sqlAlchemy
       Creating python scripts that performed sql queries for user and global statistics
       Creating python scripts that generate random equations (used for the daily quiz) and update one of the tables used to store the equations.
